# Biometric-Door-Unlock-System
A biometric door unlock system is an advanced security solution that uses unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans, to access authorized individuals. The system quickly scans and matches the user's biometric data with stored profiles, unlocking the door only if a match is found.
